The Moranometer is a simple, easy-to-use, and powerful tool for
visualizing the distribution of a variable in a dataset.

No, I am kidding, Git copilot wrote this.

The moranometer is mainly a manager for trello board with several users and moderators managed from a telegram bot. The main moderator is Moran, a **beast of enourmous strength**.

Except managing trello, it will also supply other services and knowledge about Moran.

Or in more simple words, the moranometer is a telegram bot for managing moran's services.
